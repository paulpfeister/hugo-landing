This website has only recently been republished. I'll be adding more to it as time goes on.

In addition to BTL1, I've also had Security+, but that has since expired. As I start to re-certify, either OSCP or a variety of GIAC/SANS certifications are next.

As of updating this, I am in the Top 3% of users on THM. I may begin doing CTF writeups as well.
